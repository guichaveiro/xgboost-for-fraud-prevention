# Ethereum Transactions Analysis

## About the Project
This mini data science project was developed as part of my postgraduate program in Data Science at Data Science Academy, during the course Data Science for Multivariate Data Analysis.

The goal of this project is to analyze Ethereum cryptocurrency transaction data obtained from Kaggle.  
The notebook covers the full data science workflow â€” from data cleaning and preprocessing to model training and deployment for testing purposes.

## Main Steps
- Data loading and exploration  
- Data cleaning and preprocessing  
- Feature selection and engineering  
- Model training using **XGBoost**  
- Model evaluation  
- Simple model deployment for testing  

## Disclaimer
This is my first time uploading a project to GitHub so I still have a lot to improve and to learn c:
