# Ethereum Transactions Analysis

## 📖 About the Project
This mini data science project was developed as part of my postgraduate program in **Data Science** at **Data Science Academy**, during the course *Data Science for Multivariate Data Analysis*.

The goal of this project is to analyze Ethereum cryptocurrency transaction data obtained from Kaggle.  
The notebook covers the full data science workflow — from data cleaning and preprocessing to model training and deployment for testing purposes.

## ⚙️ Main Steps
- Data loading and exploration  
- Data cleaning and preprocessing  
- Feature selection and engineering  
- Model training using **XGBoost**  
- Model evaluation  
- Simple model deployment for testing
